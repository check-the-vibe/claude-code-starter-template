# Project Tasks

## Completed Tasks

### Background Command Execution (Completed: 2025-07-12)

**Task**: Ensure commands are run in a non-blocking way so Claude can achieve true multi-tasking.

**Implementation:**
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with CRITICAL non-blocking execution section
- [x] Added Background Execution Pattern (REQUIRED) section with examples
- [x] Enhanced monitoring patterns to emphasize asynchronous checking
- [x] Added Session Status Checking Patterns with three different approaches
- [x] Clarified that vibe-session returns immediately

**Key Changes:**
1. Added explicit warnings against blocking/waiting for commands
2. Provided correct vs incorrect usage examples
3. Emphasized asynchronous status checking with multiple patterns
4. Added brief sleep only to allow commands to start, not to wait for completion
5. Documented various ways to check session output without blocking

**Result**: Claude now has clear instructions to:
- Execute vibe-session commands without waiting
- Continue with next tasks immediately
- Check session status asynchronously using vibe-logs or log files
- Achieve true parallel execution for multi-tasking
