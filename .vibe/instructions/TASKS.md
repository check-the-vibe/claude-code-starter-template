# Project Tasks

## Current Sprint - Multi-tasking

Update the CLAUDE.md file with instructions that enable Claude to do more than one task at once. When there are more than one task that are related to each other, claude should execute both commands first, in separate sessions, and then iterate through each task's session to complete, this should allow work to be going on behind the scenes in prep for the next action that is coming up. 

In order to accomplish this, you will need to be sure that when claude is executing a command that it can immediately detach from the session and continue on with the multi-tasking it is looking to do. 

think through how you are going to accomplish this, plot out the right course, test out your actions when you're done.
