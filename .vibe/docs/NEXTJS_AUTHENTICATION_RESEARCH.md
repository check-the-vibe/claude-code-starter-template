## 2. Next.js App Router Authentication Patterns

### Core Patterns (2024)

#### **Server-Side Authentication (Recommended)**
- Authentication logic handled on the server
- Enhanced security with server components
- No sensitive data exposure to client
- Better SEO and initial page load performance

#### **Client-Side Authentication**
- Authentication logic in browser
- Page fully loads before redirect logic executes
- Suitable for specific use cases but less secure

### Next.js 15 Modern Approaches

#### **Server Components + Actions API**
- Secure authentication management on server
- Seamless server communication through Actions API
- Enhanced performance and security

#### **Middleware for Route Protection**
- Dynamic permission checking
- Pre-processing authentication logic
- Secure route protection at edge level

### Implementation Best Practices
- Use middleware for A/B testing and authentication
- Implement server components for sensitive operations
- Enable strict TypeScript mode for better type safety
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

## 3. OAuth Providers Integration

### Supported Providers
Auth.js/NextAuth.js supports comprehensive OAuth integration:

#### **Major Providers**
- **Google**: Most popular choice, well-documented
- **GitHub**: Developer-friendly, easy setup
- **Discord**: Growing popularity for community apps
- **Facebook/Meta**: Social media integration
- **Twitter/X**: Social platform authentication
- **Microsoft**: Enterprise and Office 365 integration

### Integration Setup

#### **Environment Configuration**
```env
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret
AUTH_DISCORD_ID=your_discord_client_id  
AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret  
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

#### **Provider Configuration (Auth.js v5)**
```typescript
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"
import Discord from "next-auth/providers/discord"

export const { auth, handlers, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [GitHub, Google, Discord],
})
```

### Provider-Specific Setup
- **Discord**: Configure at discord.com/developers with redirect URL
- **GitHub**: Set email permissions to read-only for private addresses
- **Google**: Follow official Google OAuth documentation

## 4. Self-Hosted vs Third-Party Services

### Self-Hosted Authentication

#### **Pros**
- Complete control over user data and authentication flow
- No vendor lock-in or dependency risks
- Cost predictability (no recurring subscription fees)
- Full customization capabilities
- Privacy compliance easier to manage

#### **Cons**
- Complex security implementation responsibility
- Significant time investment for development
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Requires specialized security knowledge
- Scaling challenges as features grow

#### **Popular Self-Hosted Options**
- **Auth.js (NextAuth.js)**: Most flexible, community-supported
- **Lucia Auth**: Lightweight with straightforward API
- **Custom JWT implementation**: Maximum control, maximum complexity

### Third-Party Services

#### **Pros**
- Time and effort savings
- Professional security expertise and updates
- Enterprise features (MFA, anomaly detection)
- Automatic scaling and infrastructure management
- Multiple authentication methods out-of-box

#### **Cons**
- Vendor dependency and potential lock-in
- Ongoing subscription costs
- Limited customization options
- Compliance and data residency concerns
- Service disruption risks

#### **Cost Comparison**
- **Free tiers**: Most services offer limited free usage
- **Pricing models**: Per-user, per-authentication, or flat-rate
- **Enterprise pricing**: Often negotiated, can be expensive

### Recommendation
Unless building an Authentication-as-a-Service business, third-party solutions provide better security, features, and development speed for most applications.

## 5. Security Best Practices

### JWT and Session Management

#### **Token Storage Security**
- **Never use localStorage or sessionStorage** for JWTs
- Use HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement secure cookie flags (`secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`)

#### **Session Strategies**
- **Stateless**: Token-based, simpler but requires careful implementation
- **Database sessions**: More secure, higher server resource usage
- **Hybrid approach**: Combine benefits of both strategies

### Authentication Security Measures

#### **Token Management**
- Implement short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes)
- Use refresh tokens for seamless user experience
- Implement proper token rotation
- Secure token storage and transmission

#### **Password Security**
- Hash passwords with bcrypt or similar algorithms
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible

#### **Network Security**
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Set security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Use CSRF protection (included in Auth.js by default)

#### **Session Security**
- Implement proper session invalidation on logout
- Use short session lifetimes with automatic refresh
- Monitor for unusual authentication patterns
- Implement session concurrency controls if needed

### Next.js 15 Security Features
- Server components for secure data handling
- Enhanced middleware for route protection
- Improved Actions API for secure server communication
- Built-in CSRF protection
